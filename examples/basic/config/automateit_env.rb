# This is an environment file for AutomateIt. It's loaded by the
# AutomateIt::Interpreter immediately after loading the default tags, fields
# and the contents of your "lib" directory. This file is loaded every time you
# invoke the AutomateIt interpreter with this project, so it's a good place to
# put your custom settings so that you can access them from recipes or an
# interpreter embedded inside your Ruby code.
#
# The "self" in this file is the AutomateIt::Interpreter, so you can execute
# all the same commands that you'd normally put in a recipe. However, note that
# because this file is executed each time the interpreter is loaded, you
# probably want to limit the commands added here to setup your interpreter the
# way you want it and add convenience methods, and not commands that do actual
# configuration management.
