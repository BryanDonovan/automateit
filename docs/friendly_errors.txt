== User-friendly error messages

AutomateIt provides user-friendly error messages that make it easier to fix
problems in recipes and templates. These pinpoint the cause and show code
snippets.

For example, one of the sample recipes is executed -- but there's a problem and
the output is shown below. 

The message is telling us the error happened in the
'examples/basic/recipes/install.rb' recipe at line 47. The first snippet shows
the end of a failed TemplateManager +render+ call. 

In the second code snippet, we see there was a problem with the ERB template
'dist/myapp_server.erb'. This template failed at line 5 because it couldn't
find a variable called +pat+.

With the help of the second snippet, we quickly see that there's a typo -- that
bad variable should have been +path+. Problem solved!
