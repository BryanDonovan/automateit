    - (!) Normalized PackageManager methods and ShellManager#chperm to use consistent ':details => true' option.
    - Fixed bug in ShellManager and Tempster that created temporary files and directories in preview mode.
    - Simplified embedding with new Interpreter methods 'include_in' and 'add_method_missing_to'. Provided Rakefile with example project to demonstrate embedding.
    - Improved AccountManager to set and change passwords on user accounts.
    - Improved TagManager with lazy-loading of tags, which speeds startup.
    - Improved documentation for previewing custom commands.
    - Improved ShellManager, TemplateManager and EditManager so they translate :owner to :user for Cfengine refugees.

    - Improved Interpreter with friendly error messages that make it easier for users to see what's wrong with a recipe. These new messages display the cause, a snapshot of the problematic code, shortened paths, and only the relevant stack frames. Also provided way to get complete, raw backtraces for debugging internals.
    - Improved plugins that use ERB by creating a new HelpfulERB class that provides sane behavior and provides friendly, contextual error messages making it much easier for users to identify and fix problems in templates.

    - (%) Fixed bug in ShellManager::Portable that caused 'cp' to actually copy even when in 'noop' mode.
    - Ported code to work with JRuby.
    - Wrote TagParser that works with JRuby and handles arbitrarily complex and deep rules with correct precedence.
    - Improved PackageManager commands to accept hash of names to paths, e.g., if package 'TracTags' isn't present, installs it from a directory.
    - Improved PackageManager commands to accept annotated, free-form strings with comments.
    - Improved Interpreter.invoke to search a project's recipes directory, making it easier for recipes to invoke other recipes.
    - Improved EditSession to provide easier access to Interpreter methods.
    - Improved ServiceManager to provide 'start_and_enable' and 'start_or_restart' convenience commands.

    Desc:
    - (%) Fixed bug in PackageManager::Gem, it wasn't recognizing packages installed multiple times as being installed.
    - Provided complete support for CentOS and RedHat.
    - Provided complete support for Gentoo with new PackageManager::Portage and ServiceManager::RC_Update drivers.
    - Provided basic support for FreeBSD with new PlatformManager::FreeBSD.
    - Rewrote AddressManager::Linux using pure 'ifconfig' calls, which provide more universal support than 'iproute'.
    - Reworked examples to create a user for the application, demonstrating the use of AccountManager and eliminating need for workarounds to platform-specific differences for the 'nobody' account.
    - Added new 'depends_on' option to check complex dependencies using callbacks, e.g., ensure a specific version of ifconfig.
    - Included examples/basic in Gem distribution, the code used in the Screenshots.

        - (%) Fixed bug where a project's fields were sometimes accidentally cleared. Wrote tests to make sure this won't happen again.
        - Added tests for examples/basic recipes.
        - Added ServiceManager started? and stopped? methods with wait timeouts.

        - (!) Reworked Plugins so drivers find managers by inheritance, rather than by name. Simplifies code and allows drivers in different namespaces than their manager. Should be one of the last changes that breaks backwards-compatibility in Plugins for a while.

        - Added initial support for Apple Mac OS X. Includes a PlatformManager driver for Darwin, and assorted changes needed for AutomateIt to run on the old Ruby 1.8.2 bundled with Tiger.
        - Fixed AddressManager by eliminating exceptions raised on misconfigured systems that didn't have IPs for local hostnames.

    Desc:
        - (!) Created AbstractDriver classes for each plugin and made the concrete drivers subclass these.
        - Wrote tests for CLI, which create projects, invoke recipes, run the interactive shell, etc.
        - Eliminated need for custom drivers to run 'setup' on their associated plugin instance.
