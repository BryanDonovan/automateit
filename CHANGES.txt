    Date: Sat, 06 Oct 2007 17:55:37 -0700
    Desc:
    - (%) Fixed EditSession#delete to delete lines matching substrings rather than exact matches.
    - Fixed EditSession#comment to not comment already commented-out lines.
    - Fixed SessionManager#start and #stop so these don't check status when called with :force option.

0.71003:
    Date: Wed, 03 Oct 2007 01:17:32 -0700
    Desc:
    - Fixed bug in #backup on JRuby because it lacks methods to query properties. It now copies the file and timestamp, but not the owner/group/mode because these can't be queried on JRuby.
    - Improved #cp with new :preserve => :try option so that properties are preserved when possible, but no exception is thrown when these can't be preserved.

    Date: Fri, 28 Sep 2007 23:18:37 -0700

    - (%) Fixed #cp, #ln and #install when called with relative path source and directory target. These tried to create items which included the relative path, rather than discarding it.
    - (+) Added an "--add TAGS" feature to executables: automateit, aifield, aitag. This makes it easy to define tag(s) for a specific run.
    - (+) Added #backup command to save copies of files, it's now used by default when using #edit to modify a file.
    - (+) Added #download command to retrieve data via HTTP and FTP to a file or directory.

    Desc:
    - (!) Normalized PackageManager methods and ShellManager#chperm to use consistent ':details => true' option.

0.70915:
    Date: Sat, 15 Sep 2007 23:09:26 -0700
    Desc:
    - Improved Interpreter with friendly error messages that make it easier for users to see what's wrong with a recipe. These new messages display the cause, a snapshot of the problematic code, shortened paths, and only the relevant stack frames. Also provided way to get complete, raw backtraces for debugging internals.
    - Improved plugins that use ERB by creating a new HelpfulERB class that provides sane behavior and provides friendly, contextual error messages making it much easier for users to identify and fix problems in templates.

0.70914:
    Date: Fri, 14 Sep 2007 17:37:48 -0700

    - Ported code to work with JRuby.
    - Wrote TagParser that works with JRuby and handles arbitrarily complex and deep rules with correct precedence.

    - Provided basic support for FreeBSD with new PlatformManager::FreeBSD.
    - Rewrote AddressManager::Linux using pure 'ifconfig' calls, which provide more universal support than 'iproute'.
    - Reworked examples to create a user for the application, demonstrating the use of AccountManager and eliminating need for workarounds to platform-specific differences for the 'nobody' account.
    - Added new 'depends_on' option to check complex dependencies using callbacks, e.g., ensure a specific version of ifconfig.
    - Included examples/basic in Gem distribution, the code used in the Screenshots.

    Date: Mon, 10 Sep 2007 19:34:25 -0700
    Desc:
        - (!) Reworked Plugins so drivers find managers by inheritance, rather than by name. Simplifies code and allows drivers in different namespaces than their manager. Should be one of the last changes that breaks backwards-compatibility in Plugins for a while.

    Date: Sun, 09 Sep 2007 16:39:58 -0700
    Desc:
