        - Added ServiceManager started? and stopped? methods with wait timeouts.

        - (!) Reworked Plugins so drivers find managers by inheritance, rather than by name. Simplifies code and allows drivers in different namespaces than their manager. Should be one of the last changes that breaks backwards-compatibility in Plugins for a while.

        - Added initial support for Apple Mac OS X. Includes a PlatformManager driver for Darwin, and assorted changes needed for AutomateIt to run on the old Ruby 1.8.2 bundled with Tiger.
        - Fixed AddressManager by eliminating exceptions raised on misconfigured systems that didn't have IPs for local hostnames.

        - Eliminated need for custom drivers to run 'setup' on their associated plugin instance.
