  class Plugin
    # == Plugin::Driver
    #
    # A driver provides the low-level functionality for features, e.g., the
    # PackageManager::APT driver is responsible for installing a software
    # package using the Debian <tt>apt-get</tt> command. Multiple drivers
    # providing common functionality are managed by a single Manager class,
    # e.g., drivers that install software packages are managed by the
    # PackageManager.
    #
    # A driver may only be available on certain platforms and provides its
    # manager with an idea of when it's suitable. For example, if a platform
    # doesn't have the <tt>apt-get</tt> command, the PackageManager::APT driver
    # must tell the PackageManager class that it's not suitable.
    #
    # === Writing your own drivers
    #
    # To write a driver, find the most similar driver available for a specific
    # plugin, copy it, and rework its code. Save the code for the new driver in
    # a file ending with .rb into the projectâ€™s +lib+ directory, it will be
    # automatically loaded whenever the Interpreter for that project is run.
    # Please test and contribute drivers so that others can benefit.
    #
    # IMPORTANT GOTCHA: You must prefix the AutomateIt module name with a "::"!
    #
    # Here's a minimalistic PackageManager that can be dropped into +lib+:
    #
    #   class MyDriver < ::AutomateIt::PackageManager::BaseDriver

    #       # Never select as default driver
    #       return 0
