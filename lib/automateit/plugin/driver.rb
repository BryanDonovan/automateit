    # == Plugin::Driver
    #
    # A driver provides the low-level functionality for features, e.g., the
    # PackageManager::APT driver is responsible for installing a software
    # package using the Debian <tt>apt-get</tt> command. Multiple drivers
    # providing common functionality are managed by a single Manager class,
    # e.g., drivers that install software packages are managed by the
    # PackageManager.
    #
    # A driver may only be available on certain platforms and provides its
    # manager with an idea of when it's suitable. For example, if a platform
    # doesn't have the <tt>apt-get</tt> command, the PackageManager::APT driver
    # must tell the PackageManager class that it's not suitable.
    #
    # === Writing your own drivers
    #
    # To write a driver, find the most similar driver available for a specific
    # plugin, copy it, and rework its code. Save the code for the new driver in
    # a file ending with .rb into the projectâ€™s +lib+ directory, it will be
    # automatically loaded whenever the Interpreter for that project is run.
    # Please test and contribute drivers so that others can benefit.
    #
    # IMPORTANT GOTCHA: You must prefix the AutomateIt module name with a "::",
    # or the driver will be imported into the AutomateIt::Interpreter namespace
    # and get lost. 
    #
    # Here's a minimalistic PackageManager that can be dropped into +lib+:
    # 
    #   class ::AutomateIt::PackageManager::MyDriver < ::AutomateIt::PackageManager::AbstractDriver
    #     depends_on :nothing
    #
    #     def suitability(method, *args) # :nodoc:
    #       # Never select as default driver
    #       return 0
    #     end
    #   end
    #--
    # TODO Remove need to use namespace to declare driver and instead have abstract drivers add ANYTHING that includes them, regardless of the name. However, this will be tricky because it'll require rethinking how the registration process works.
