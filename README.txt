=== What is AutomateIt and why should you care?

Manual system administration processes are expensive and put your business at risk. AutomateIt is an open-source tool for automating the setup and maintenance of UNIX systems. It helps your company speed up development, deliver high-quality application and network services, reduce errors and downtime, and can rebuild entire clusters with a single command.

AutomateIt lets you write recipes that encapsulate your system setup and maintenance tasks into portable, repeatable and maintainable recipes. These recipes are so easy to understand that any UNIX user will be able to read them without additional training. Yet despite this easy of use, AutomateIt is the most powerful and feature-packed tool available. You can quickly adapt it to your unique needs by writing plugins and drivers with the embedded, full-featured programming language.

Unlike most competing products, AutomateIt is built to solve real-world problems. Its design is the result of over a decade of hard-won lessons administering business-critical applications at geographically-distributed data-centers with hundreds of servers in multiple clusters, dozens of OSes and countless configuration permutations. AutomateIt gives you all the features of industry-standard configuration management products like cfengine, but is more powerful, flexible and easier-to-use.

=== Support

Professional services for AutomateIt are available through Pragmaticraft[http://Pragmaticraft.com].

Community support and release notifications are available at the http://AutomateIt.org website.

=== Beta

AutomateIt is beta-quality software. It's feature-complete, exceeds the capabilities of other major products, and ensures its quality with a test suite that provides nearly-complete code coverage. However, this is a young, product and early users should have a high-degree of technical understanding, be willing to accept rough spots and work through problems. Driver support for some operating systems is limited, although users are encouraged to write and submit drivers or provide access to their platforms so the product's authors can write these. Users are expected to sign up at the http://AutomateIt.org website so they can be notified of releases and apply these updates regularly to take advantage of bugfixes and new features.
