=== What is AutomateIt and why should you care?

Manual system administration processes are expensive and put your business at risk. AutomateIt is a new open-source tool for automating the setup and maintenance of UNIX-like systems. It helps your company speed up development, deliver high-quality application and network services, reduce errors and downtime, and can rebuild entire clusters with a single command.

AutomateIt lets you write recipes that encapsulate your system setup and maintenance tasks into portable, repeatable and maintainable recipes. These recipes are so easy to understand that any UNIX user will be able to read them without additional training. Yet when you need it, AutomateIt is the most powerful and feature-packed tool available. You can quickly adapt it to your unique needs by writing plugins and drivers with the embedded, full-featured programming language.

Unlike most competing products, AutomateIt is built to solve real-world problems. Its design is the result of over a decade of hard-won lessons administering sites with multiple clusters at distributed data-centers with hundreds of servers, dozens of OSes and countless configuration permutations. AutomateIt gives you all the features of industry leading products like cfengine, but is more powerful, flexible and easier-to-use.
