= AutomateIt's todo list

=== Software

Bugs
* Interpreter -- can a "def"ed method in a recipe can be made visible within that recipe?
* AccountManager -- Solaris fails 5% of the time on the last spec. WTF?
* AccountManager -- OpenBSD stalls if it thinks a password's quality sucks. What to do?
* AccountManager -- OpenBSD fails "should add groups to a user" and "should add users to group".

Needs improvement
* Interpreter#invoke and HelpfulERB -- Extract error context code into separate, reusable classes
* FieldManager -- Wrap #lookup("my#deep#non-existent#path") with friendly exceptions
* ServiceManager -- Write tests for start_and_enable and such
* ServiceManager -- Create new #stop_and_start, and add new #restart as #tell wrapper
* PackageManager -- Improve PEAR spec by having it check files with and without channel URL
* PackageManager -- Add options to all drivers for specifying commands to use, like in `package_manager.install(:with => :gem, :gem => "gem1.8")`
* Shell -- Consistently return single items or arrays, alter specs to match

Needs redesign
* AccountManager::NSCD -- Driver calls "ps -ef", which is bad and needs abstraction. Create and use ProcessManager?

New features
* Tags and fields -- Add "fields.local.yml" and "tags.local.yml"
* Interpreter -- Add a way to demand a particular version of AutomateIt, maybe `needs_version ">=0.80624"` in automateit_env.rb
* Driver -- Provide public way to determine if a driver method is available?
* ScheduleManager -- Design, or write wrapper for RubyCron or such
* ProcessManger -- Design (provides "ps -ef" and such), add #pgrep and #pmatch methods
* Edit -- Display summary of edits, return with :details as [rv, list]
* Shell -- Write #su(user, *command) as a wrapper around #sh
* Shell -- Expand glob patterns, e.g. chown_R(500, 500, "*")
* Shell#chperm -- With symbolic mode, wrap `chmod -v` as temporary workaround?
* Shell#chperm -- Accept varargs as argument, not just string or array

New drivers
* PackageManager::FreeBSD_Ports - Implement (or make generic ::Ports? and FreeBSD_Pkg
* PackageManager -- Fink and MacPorts (or generic ::Ports?)
* PackageManager -- Upgrade or install specific versions
* PackageManager::Blastwave -- Implement
* PackageManager::SunOS_Pkg -- Implement
* ServiceManager::SMF -- Implement
